# Design notes

## Python version

`requires-python` is `>=3.13,<3.14`. Checked on PyPI on 2026-10-06:

| Package | Latest stable | Newest CPython wheel (macOS arm64 and Linux x86_64) |
|---|---|---|
| torch | 2.14.1 | 3.14 |
| onnxruntime | 1.30.0 | 3.14 |
| qai-hub | 0.56.0 | pure Python, `>=3.10` |
| coremltools | 9.0 | 3.13 |

coremltools sets the ceiling. Only the 9.1.dev1 pre-release ships cp314 wheels. Move to 3.14 once a stable coremltools release does.

## Tests and sockets

pytest runs with `--disable-socket --allow-unix-socket`. With `--disable-socket` alone, every anyio test on the asyncio backend fails during teardown with `AttributeError: '_UnixSelectorEventLoop' object has no attribute '_ssock'`, because the selector event loop builds its self-pipe with `socket.socketpair()`, which pytest-socket blocks. `--allow-unix-socket` permits only `AF_UNIX`, so TCP and UDP stay blocked.

## CI dependencies

CI runs `uv sync --locked`, which installs the runtime core and the dev group but no extras. Nothing in the core imports torch, and on Linux x86_64 the locked torch wheel plus its 15 `nvidia-*` CUDA dependencies come to about 3.0 GB of downloads.
